# Snake Game
## Author: Dominion Aromolaran

### Brief Project Description
 This game was developed from  maintaining and extending a re-implementation of a classic retro game called Snake. The original implementation was developed by **Sigurður Sigurðardóttir** .A player maneuvers a snake across a field to collect food and avoid obstacles and boundaries.
