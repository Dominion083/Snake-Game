### Movement Logic:

| **Question**                                                   | **Answer**                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Where is the direction of the snake set based on user input?   | In the `keyPressed` method of the `MySnake` class.                                   |
| How is the snake moved in the chosen direction?                | The movement is implemented in the `move` method of the `MySnake` class.             |
| What triggers the movement of the snake?                       | The movement of the snake is triggered in the `draw` method of the `MySnake` class.  |
| Is there any condition for stopping the movement of the snake? | Yes, if the snake goes out of bounds (hits the walls), its `l` flag is set to false. |

### Scoring Logic:

| **Question**                                           | **Answer**                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Where is the initial score set?                        | The initial score is set to 0 when the `MySnake` object is created.                                                                                 |
| How is the score updated when the snake eats the food? | The score is updated in the `eaten` method of the `Food` class when the snake eats the food.                                                        |
| Is there any other condition for updating the score?   | Currently, the only condition for updating the score is when the snake eats the food. Additional conditions can be added based on the game's logic. |

### Rendering Logic:

| **Question**                                                          | **Answer**                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| How is the game frame continuously updated for rendering?             | The `MyThread` class continuously calls the `repaint` method in the `MyFrame` class.                             |
| How are key events related to rendering handled?                      | The `keyTyped`, `keyPressed`, and `keyReleased` methods in the `MyFrame` class handle key events.                |
| What does the `paint` method in the `MyFrame` class do?               | The `paint` method in the `MyFrame` class draws the game components on the frame.                                |
| What does the `paint` method in the `Play` class do?                  | The `paint` method in the `Play` class draws the background, snake, food, and manages the game flow.             |
| How is the player's score rendered on the frame?                      | The `drawScore` method in the `Play` class draws the player's score on the frame.                                |
| How is the food rendered on the game frame?                           | The `draw` method in the `Food` class draws the food image on the game frame.                                    |
| How are images managed for rendering?                                 | The `ImageUtil` class manages images using an `images` Map containing image resources used in the game.          |
| How does the `getImage` method in `GameUtil` contribute to rendering? | The `getImage` method in the `GameUtil` class loads an image from the specified path, contributing to rendering. |
| How is background music rendered in the game?                         | The `play` method in the `MusicPlayer` class starts a new thread to play the background music.                   |

### How can an MVC Pattern be implemented
| Question                                                                                              | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| How is the game data represented in the Model of your Java game?                                      | In the Model of the game, data is represented through classes like `MySnake`, `Food`, and other relevant entities, managing the state and behavior of the game.                                                                     |
| What org.example.View components are used to visually represent the game state?                                   | In the org.example.View, components like `MyFrame` and associated classes are used to visually represent the game state. These include the game window, snake, food, and other graphical elements.                                              |
| How does the Controller handle user input in the context of an MVC game?                              | The Controller, implemented in classes like `MyFrame` and `Play`, handles user input through methods like `keyPressed`, responding to key events and updating the Model accordingly.                                                |
| Can you describe a specific instance where the Model is updated in response to user actions?          | An example would be when the snake in the game (`MySnake` class) changes direction in response to arrow key presses. The Controller updates the Model to reflect this change.                                                       |
| How does the game achieve communication between the Model and org.example.View components?                        | Communication is facilitated by the Controller, where updates in the Model trigger corresponding changes in the org.example.View. For instance, when the snake moves, the org.example.View is updated to reflect this movement.                             |
| Are there specific Java Swing or JavaFX components used in the org.example.View to enhance the gaming experience? | In the org.example.View, Java Swing components like `JFrame` are utilized, along with custom-painted components to display game elements. The `Play` class manages the graphical rendering of the game.                                         |
| What benefits does the MVC pattern bring to the design and maintenance of the  game code?             | The MVC pattern provides a clear separation of concerns, making the code modular and easier to maintain. Changes in one component, such as updating game logic (Model), won't directly impact the visual representation (org.example.View).     |
| How does the game handle score updates, and which components are involved?                            | Score updates are handled in the Model (e.g., `MySnake` and `Food` classes) and are triggered when the snake eats food. The Controller manages this interaction, updating both the Model and the org.example.View to display the updated score. |

   - Confirms that food is not marked as eaten right after initialization.

4. **testSetEaten**:
   - Checks if the food can be correctly marked as eaten.

5. **testSetPoints**:
   - Ensures that the points value is set correctly and retrieved accurately.

6. **testGetRectangle**:
   - Tests whether a non-null bounding rectangle is returned post food initialization.

#### Test Cases for GameController(All Passed)

1. **testSnakeMovement**:
   - Validates that the snake's X position changes after movement, ensuring that the snake can move properly in the game environment.

2. **testSnakeEatsFood**:
